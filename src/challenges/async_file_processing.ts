/**
 * Asynchronous File Processing
 *
 * Write a Node.js script that reads a list of file paths
 * from an input file (one path per line), processes each
 * file asynchronously to count the number of lines, and
 * then writes the results to an output file in the
 * format: filename: line count.
 * Use asynchronous file reading/writing and ensure that all files are processed concurrently.
