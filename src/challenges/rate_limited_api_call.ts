/**
 * Rate-Limited API Calls
 *
 * Implement a function that makes API calls to a hypothetical
 * rate-limited service. The function should accept an array of
 * request parameters and return a promise that resolves with the
 * array of responses. Use async/await and ensure that the function
 * respects the rate limit (e.g., 5 requests per second) without
 * exceeding it.
