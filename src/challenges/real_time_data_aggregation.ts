/**
 * Real-time Data Aggregation
 * Create a simple server using Express.js that aggregates
 * real-time data from multiple sources. The server should
 * have an endpoint that, when hit, fetches data concurrently
 * from multiple URLs (provided in the query parameters) using
 * asynchronous requests, combines the data, and returns the
 * aggregated result. Handle errors gracefully and ensure that
 * all requests are made in parallel.
